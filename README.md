# Mark Rickey — Portfolio

This repository contains the source for my professional portfolio site.

The site is intentionally minimal and signal-driven.  
It is designed for hiring managers, partners, and decision-makers who value clarity, execution, and measurable outcomes over visual noise.

---

## What this site demonstrates

- **Operating discipline**  
  Strategy translated into operating models, decision rights, cadence, and execution artifacts.

- **Measured outcomes**  
  Case studies emphasize clarity gained, friction removed, and decision velocity improved.

- **Communication under constraint**  
  Dense, structured writing intended to be skimmed by senior leaders.

- **Modern, restrained front-end execution**  
  Subtle motion, interactive diagrams, and clean layout — without unnecessary frameworks.

---

## Technical overview

- **Static HTML / CSS / JavaScript**
- **GitHub Pages compatible**
- **No build tools or frameworks required**
- **Mermaid.js** for live operating model and decision-rights diagrams
- **Native scroll-reveal and micro-interactions**
- **Single-file architecture** for transparency and maintainability

This is a deliberate choice. The site favors longevity and clarity over novelty.

## Why this exists

This portfolio is not a gallery.  
It is an **artifact** — similar to the briefs, dashboards, and operating documents I produce in real roles.

If you are reviewing this repository, you are likely evaluating:
- fit for program / project leadership
- public affairs or communications leadership
- digital operations or governance roles
- consulting or advisory work in complex environments

The site is built accordingly.
